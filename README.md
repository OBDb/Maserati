## About Maserati

Maserati is an Italian luxury vehicle manufacturer established on December 1, 1914, in Bologna, Italy. Known for producing high-performance luxury cars with distinctive designs and race-bred engineering, Maserati has become synonymous with Italian automotive excellence and exclusivity.

## Generations

- **Pre-War Era (1914-1945)**: Founded by the Maserati brothers (Alfieri, Bindo, Carlo, Ettore, and Ernesto), the company initially focused on developing race cars. During this period, Maserati established its racing pedigree with cars like the Tipo 26, which won the 1926 Targa Florio. After the Maserati brothers sold their shares to the Orsi family in 1937, the company relocated to Modena, where it remains headquartered today.

- **Post-War Expansion (1946-1967)**: Following World War II, Maserati began producing grand touring cars alongside its racing models. Notable vehicles from this era include the iconic A6 series and the 3500 GT, which marked Maserati's successful transition into road car production. The company's racing success continued with the 250F Formula One car, which Juan Manuel Fangio drove to win the F1 World Championship in 1957.

- **Citroën Ownership (1968-1975)**: Under Citroën's control, Maserati developed innovative models like the Bora (Maserati's first mid-engine road car) and the Merak. This period saw technological advancements but also financial struggles that eventually led to the company's bankruptcy in 1975.

- **De Tomaso Era (1976-1993)**: Rescued by Italian industrialist Alejandro de Tomaso, Maserati shifted focus to more accessible luxury sports cars like the Biturbo series. While commercially successful, quality issues during this period affected the brand's reputation.

- **Fiat Ownership (1993-2004)**: After acquisition by Fiat, Maserati was initially paired with Ferrari (1997), leading to improved engineering and build quality. The 3200 GT and subsequent models marked a return to Maserati's luxury GT roots with Ferrari-derived engines.

- **Modern Era (2005-present)**: Now part of Stellantis (following the Fiat Chrysler and PSA Group merger), Maserati has expanded its lineup to include the Quattroporte sedan, Levante SUV, MC20 supercar, and the electric Folgore range. This period represents Maserati's most diverse product portfolio, combining traditional luxury grand touring with modern technology and electrification.
